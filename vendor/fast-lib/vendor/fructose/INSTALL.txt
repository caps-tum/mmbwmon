FRUCTOSE is designed to work just using the header files,
so there is no build and install as such. Simply make the
headers available in whatever part of your compilation
environment you find convenient. Note that they must reside
in a directory called fructose.

The examples come with Makefiles. The Makefiles have been
produced using the build system MakeProjectCreator (MPC).
The MPC input files are supplied along with the Makefiles
they produced. The Makefiles are suitable for use with
most Unix systems. The MPC files can be used to produce
project files that will work with various versions of
Microsoft Visual Studio (6,7,8,9,10).

In the FRUCTOSE tarball a peer of the fructose directory called
hamcrest-c++, which is the C++ port of hamcrest matchers
by Jon Reid. Included within this is an MPC file (MakeProjectCreator),
so that hamcrest can be built as a library using either make or
Visual Studio. To use FRUCTOSE and hamcrest, compile your test
harnesses with the macro FRUCTOSE_USING_HAMCREST.
